            <p>Zeke was my first cat. He was
               a rescue from a shelter in my 
               hometown of Findlay, Ohio. He was
               found on the side of the road.

            <h3>Jax</h3>
            <p><img src="/FinalProject/images/jaxkitten.jpg" alt="Jax Kitten" style="width:350px;height:450px"></p>
            <p>Jax was my second cat. I got him a few months after adopting Zeke so he would have a playmate. Jax was
               unfortunately hit by a car when he was a kitten and brought in with a severely broken leg. It required
               screws right below his knee joint to fuse the leg back together.
